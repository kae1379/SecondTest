In the town where I was born
Lived the man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines.

So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine,
We all live in a yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

And our friends are all aboard,
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine,
We all live in a yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

As we live a life of ease (life of ease)
Every one of us (every one of us)
has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue, (sky of blue) and sea of green
(sea of green)
In our yellow (in our yellow) submarine.(submarine) ( Haha! )
